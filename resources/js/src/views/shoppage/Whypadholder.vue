            <h4>PRODUCT VARIETY</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>
              Not only do we have holders that fit nearly every tablet out there, including every iPad model, but they all come in several different styles. All of our holders, through the use of spacers and tensioners, allow a large variety of tablets to be installed with or without cases.
            </p>
            <ul class="pl-6">
              <li>• Our non-locking holders are perfect for home use. You can quickly and easily slide your tablet, with or without it's case, in and out of the holder.</li>
              <li>• Our locking holders add security by enabling you to physically lock your tablet in to the holder with lock and key. Also, with each holder, we include a set of tamper-proof bolts that you can swap out with the default bolts for added security.</li>
              <li>• Our full enclosure holders offer a little bit of both worlds. We call them our Hybrid holders. They offer quick access and locking solutions with the simple install or removal of a bolt. They also look great once installed. The high-quality acrylic almost extends the surface of the tablet and still allows access to all cable ports and buttons.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>
              All of our mounts offer a hands-free solution when using your tablet, and there is a mount for nearly every application. We have stands for relaxing in bed or on the couch, mounts for working in your home-office, driving around town or riding in the back seat, and even a table top mount for using in the kitchen while you're cooking or just about anywhere else you can think of.
            </p>
            <ul class="pl-6">
              <li>• All of our mounts are constructed with high-quality materials to give you that feeling of security you need when something else is holding your expensive electronics.</li>
              <li>• Our mounts are versatile. Swing and swivel your mount to get it exactly where you want it, then lock it down for a nice solid hold. No drooping, sagging, or swaying.</li>
              <li>• We've developed car and truck dash mounts for over a thousand different makes and models. If that isn't enough, we've also developed a cup holder mount that can easily adjust to fit in pretty much any cup holder. We even have a floor mount that bolts to your passenger seat. All of our vehicle mounts require absolutely no drilling and no destruction of any kind to your vehicle.</li>
            </ul>
